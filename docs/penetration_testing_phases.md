# Phases of Penetration Testing

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
* Set up the local development environment
* Installed necessary security testing tools
* Reviewed the pokelearn application documentation
* Defined testing scope and objectives

## Phase 2: Discovery and Reconnaissance
* Performed network scanning to identify running services
* Enumerated open ports and service versions
* Mapped application endpoints and functionality
* Identified technologies and frameworks in use
* Analyzed web application structure and behavior

## Phase 3: Attack and Exploitation
