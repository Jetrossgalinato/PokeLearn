| Finding | Severity | Description | Impact | Tools | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FINDING #1: UNMANAGED MYSQL DATABASE SERVICE | Critical (9.8) | An unmanaged MySQL database service was found running on port 3306. This service is not used by the PokeLearn application and appears to be a leftover or misconfiguration. | This exposed service provides a massive, high-value attack surface. An attacker can perform brute-force attacks, exploit known MySQL vulnerabilities, or potentially gain full control of the database. | `Nmap` | The MySQL service should be immediately stopped and disabled. (`sudo systemctl stop mysql && sudo systemctl disable mysql`) |
| FINDING #2: CREDENTIALS TRANSMITTED IN URL | High (8.1) | The application's login form on `/login` uses an HTTP GET request to transmit credentials, sending the user's password in the URL. | This is a critical information disclosure. Passwords will be stored in plain text in browser history, server logs, and proxy logs. | `Browser Dev Tools (Network Tab)` | The login form MUST be re-architected to use an HTTP POST request, sending the credentials in the body of the request, not the URL. |
| FINDING #3: EXPOSED POSTGRESQL DATABASE | High (7.5) | The host's PostgreSQL database service (port 5432) is accessible from the network. This is the application's primary database. | Exposing a database port directly to the network provides attackers with a direct target for brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. | `Nmap` | Configure a host-based firewall (e.g., `ufw`) to block all incoming connections to port 5432 except for those from `localhost` (127.0.0.1). |
| FINDING #4: MISSING CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (CSP) | Medium (6.1) | The application does not send a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. | Without a CSP, the application is more vulnerable to XSS. If an attacker injects a script, the browser has no instructions to block it, potentially leading to session hijacking. | `OWASP ZAP` | Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the `next.config.js` file to whitelist trusted sources for scripts, styles, and images (e.g., `'self'` and `pokeapi.co`). |
| FINDING #5: MISSING ANTI-CLICKJACKING HEADER | Medium (4.3) | The application is missing an `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` header. | This allows the application to be vulnerable to Clickjacking. An attacker can load the site in a transparent `<iframe>` over their own malicious site to trick a logged-in user. | `OWASP ZAP` | Add the `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` header to all responses, which can be done in the `next.config.js` file. |
| FINDING #6: UNNECESSARY WEB SERVER (APACHE) | Medium (5.3) | An unused Apache web server (httpd) is running on port 80. The application is served by Next.js on port 3000, making this redundant. | This service increases the host's attack surface. An attacker can target the Apache server with its own set of vulnerabilities. | `Nmap` | The Apache service should be stopped and disabled. (`sudo systemctl stop apache2 && sudo systemctl disable apache2`) |
| FINDING #7: UNNECESSARY PRINTER SERVICE (CUPS) | Low (3.1) | The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) is running on port 631. This service is for managing printers, not serving web apps. | While the immediate risk is low, any unnecessary service is a potential liability and poor security hygiene. | `Nmap` | The CUPS service should be stopped and disabled. (`sudo systemctl stop cups && sudo systemctl disable cups`) |
